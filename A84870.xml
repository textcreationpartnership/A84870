         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hee will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the poore diſpoſition of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſleepe and be at quiet for want of new ſupplyes and aſſiſtants to further her vnlawfull practiſe. This Kingdome hath had too frequent experience of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous intentions and plots, which had not the all-ſeeing eye of Heaven prevented, we had long agoe beene brought to vtter ruine and deſtruction.

In <hi>Derby-ſhire</hi> ſome Thirteene Miles from Derby Towne, lieth a Towne called by the name of <hi>Bingly,</hi> a ſmall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Town but of good Bigneſſe, inhabited by good ſort of men of great Ranke and Quality, among the reſt their lived one Mr. <hi>Thomas Needham,</hi> a man of large poſſeſſions, but by profeſſion a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholique, this <hi>Needham</hi> had gotten vnto him many of the ſame profeſſion, and by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of one <hi>Iohn Simonds,</hi> whom they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for their porpoſe, had convay'd by night by a private Doore into the Church into a great Vault vnderneath the Ground 34. Barrells of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with ſtore of ſmall peeces of old Iron, ſome Stones, and Faggots, whereby they had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the time of Divine Service, to ſubvert and blow vp the aforeſaid Church in the time of Divine Service, when the Church was filled with a full number of the Pariſhioners, but thanks be to God; their deſigne was prevented and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners deſtined for Ruine, as yet ſafe and alive, The Diſcovery was after this maner, it happened that one <hi>Iacob Franklin</hi> beeing the Sexton of the aforeſaid Pariſh of <hi>Bingly</hi> had occaſion to goe to the Church late in the Evening to Tole the paſſing
<pb facs="tcp:111965:3"/>Bell for a Neighbour who then lay deſperatly ſick as he was entred into the Church he heard a great noyſe vnderneath the Ground, which put this Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton into a great affright and amazement, ſo that leaving to performe the Duty, hee came about, he betooke himſelfe home, and told his wife what noyſe hee had heard in the Church under ground, who willed him to call ſome of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and take them along with him, and to goe and performe what did belong unto him to do. He did according to his wives directions and councell, and as he entred into the Church accompanied with ſome of his Neighbours they all heard the ſame noyſe, not knowing from whence it ſhould proceed, and at length as he was paſſing by to the place where he ſhould tole the Bell, through the cranny or cracke of a ſtone, he received the Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a light to ſhine forth of the Vault, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they drew neere the mouth of the ſaid Vault, and diſcovered by their approach more light, which made them retreate backe to ſee the event of this noyſe and light, about halfe an houre after they lying in obſcurity perceived a man with a darke Lanthorne to come forth of the Vault, and perceiving him to be alone, unaccompanied with any body elſe, they drew neere unto him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the reaſon of his being there at that vnſeaſonable time, and the cauſe of his going downe into the Vault, but hee would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any thing unto them, but ſaid that they had no power to queſtion him, upon which peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory anſwer they drag'd him by violence unto
<pb facs="tcp:111965:4"/>the Conſtable, who kept him in ſafe Coſtody that night, and the next day had him before a Iuſtice of peace to be examined, which <hi>Symonds</hi> vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination confeſſed that he was an hired ſervant unto Mr. <hi>Needum,</hi> and that he did not doubt but that his Maſter would juſtifie what he had done, he further confeſſed that he was to receive twenty Markes for his ſervice, and that he had beene now 6. moneths in this imployment, to lay in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the reſt of the things in the Vault, and that their deſigne was in the time of Divine Service, to have blowne up the Church and killed all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners that ſhould have beene at that time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and that if he had not beene at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent taken, by the next Sunday they ſhould have vnderſtood the end and intention of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. He confeſſed further, that this his Maſter was not alone in this Plot, but that he had more adherents in the buſineſſe, ſome of which, hee at that time made mention of, as of one Mr. <hi>Richard Danzy</hi> Eſquire, Mr. <hi>Thomas Overlie,</hi> and Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Gray,</hi> Gentlemen all of the ſaid County. After this his examination taken, his mittimus was made, and he ſent unto <hi>Darby</hi> Goale, where he now remains, and immediately this ſtrict charge was given by the Juſtice of the Peace, that ſearch ſhould be made in the Vault, which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, where they found the Gunpowder ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his confeſſion, and all things elſe, after which they did proceed to apprehend ſome of thoſe whom this <hi>Symonds</hi> had confeſſed to be in
